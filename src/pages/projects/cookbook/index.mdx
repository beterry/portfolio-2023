## Purpose and Goal

I really enjoy cooking dinner for my wife and I every night. However, as much as I’d like to be an expert chef, I’m not…which means I rely heavily on following recipes to create anything enjoyable to eat. 

I gather recipes from around the internet: Youtube, cooking blogs, and other recipe apps. I ran into several problems where most blogs were unreadable due to many advertisements, it was difficult to gather a recipe list from Youtube videos, and many recipes apps were missing some features I desired.

To solve these problems, I decided to develop a personalized cookbook to store my favorite recipes and make cooking them easier.

## Interesting Features

### Firebase Data Storage

I wanted the ability to add, delete, and modify recipes on multiple devices without editing any code. To achieve this, I aimed to store all the recipe data in a database which could be easily accessed from any browser. 

I decided to use Firebase as my backend solution. Firebase provides a very easy user experience to set-up and use a REST API. 

Firebase also allowed me to setup user permissions and logins, which I used to ensure that only I can edit my cookbook.

This was great practice using Angular services and url fetching.

### Recipe Editing

I designed and developed an intuitive recipe editing screen to allow myself to easily add and edit recipes. I can access this editing page by clicking the add button in the recipe gallery or by clicking the edit icon when viewing a recipe.

This was great practice using Angular forms. 

<ProjectImages images={[
    {
        fluid: props.data.images.edges[0].node.childImageSharp.fluid,
        caption: 'On the recipe edit page, I can create, update, and delete information from the Firebase database.'
    }
]}/>

### Preparation Tab

Often when I’m cooking dinner, my wife helps by cutting up vegetables or preparing spice mixtures. I desired two separate instructions to make following either the cooking instructions or preparation instructions easier. When viewing the recipe, I can click the preparation tab and we can work together to prepare ingredients before I start cooking. This improves my cooking experience.

### Shopping List

A feature that I love in apps such as Mealime is the shopping lists which populates with the ingredients in the recipes that you’ve selected. Unfortunately, this feature on Mealime doesn’t work when I’m cooking a recipe from another source so I wanted to add it to my custom app so I could always use it. When viewing a recipe, I can click the Add to List button to add the ingredients to my shopping list. I can also select multiple recipes from the gallery by clicking the checkmark and then clicking the Add to List button.

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    query cookbookQuery{
        mainImage: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq: "cookbook/images/main"}}) {
            edges {
                node {
                    childImageSharp {
                        fluid {
                            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        images: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq: "cookbook/images"}}, sort: {order: ASC, fields: name}) {
            edges {
                node {
                    childImageSharp {
                        fluid {
                            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
